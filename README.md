# Face Annotation Tool

This project provides an interactive interface for detecting faces in an image and adding annotations. It is built with `matplotlib`, `OpenCV` and `tkinter` and is intended for quick labeling tasks.

Run the `face` script to start the GUI. You can load an image, adjust detection sensitivity, rename detected faces and export the annotated result. The exported image keeps all labels visible by automatically shifting them if needed.
