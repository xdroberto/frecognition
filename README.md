# Face Annotation Tool

This project provides an interactive interface for detecting faces in an image and adding annotations. It is built with `matplotlib`, `OpenCV` and `tkinter` and is intended for quick labeling tasks.

Run the `face` script to start the GUI. Load an image, adjust detection sensitivity and rename or skip each face.
If a face is missed you can use **AÃ±adir cara** to draw a rectangle manually. Use the **Fecha** button to set a date (leave it blank if not needed). The exported image keeps all labels visible by automatically shifting them if needed.
